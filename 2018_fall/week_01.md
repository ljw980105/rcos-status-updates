# Status Update for Week 1

For the past 3 weeks I have worked on various UIs for the AutoDoorCtrl Project:
* We created a login screen and a switch screen to open/close doors during the first 2 weeks.
* For this week I created a Map UI to show available doors near a user's location (everything is just a mock at this point)
* The the upcoming week we will focus on getting the actual login backend to work.
