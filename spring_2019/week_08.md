# Status Update for Week 8

## Last Week's Accomplishments
* Created a [database](https://github.com/AutomaticDoorControl/AutomaticDoorControl/blob/master/DoorsData.json) of doors that resides inside the default AutomaticDoorControl repository as a JSON file. 
* Got the app to work with this new database by:
    * Download the database and cache it on device upon successful user login.
    * Once the app scans for Bluetooth peripherals and found one, then it's name must match an entry in the database before it appear in the scan results. This prevents unwanted BLE peripherals from being connected.

## This Week's Plan
* Start to prepare for the presentaiton.
* Keep working on the admin / standard user feature separation feature.
