# Status Update for Week 6

## Last Week's Accomplishments
* The feature to separate admin and typical user functionalities has been selected to be part of my exam for SD&D. So, as required by the exam, I'm currently concocting a plan to implementing these features. Such plans include creating classes and collaborators, and incorporation SOLID principles to the design.
* Swift 5 will be released soon. I'm currently learning new features of Swift 5 so we can migrate the iOS project to Swift 5.

## This Week's Plan
* Continue working on separating admin and typical user functionalities. 
* Continue learning Swift 5.
