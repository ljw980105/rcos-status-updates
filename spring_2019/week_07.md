# Status Update for Week 7

## Last Week's Accomplishments
* Completely updated the project to use Swift 5.
* Updated the animation framework Lottie and rewrote some code that uses it, since Lottie has been rewritten in Swift (previously it was written in objective-c).
* Updated Travis CI to build with Swift 5 (took me like 10 tries to fix a weird bug).

## This Week's Plan
* Start creating a backend to store doors information so the app can fetch from the backend and display these data to the user once they scan for the doors. 
* Continue working on the feature to separate standard users and admins.
