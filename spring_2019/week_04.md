# Status Update for Week 4

## Last Week's Accomplishments
* Finished a few voiceover features for accessibility, which include:
    * `Accessiblity Labels` for all UI elements. Voice over will read them out when users tap on them.
    * Hints for what will happen once a voiceover user interact with UI elements.
    * Feature to read Bluetooth strength information back to the user.
    * Feature to announce how much time remains before the door closes, in seconds.

## This Week's Plan
* Continue working on accessibility.
* Fix a critical issue where a voiceover user may not be able to unlock a door, due to a UI element being not accessible.
