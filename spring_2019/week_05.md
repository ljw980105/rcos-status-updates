# Status Update for Week 5

## Last Week's Accomplishments
* Fixed the error where a voiceover user may not be able to unlock the door by allowing such users to enter the unlock screen by **shaking the device** . 
* Basic accessibility features are done.

## This Week's Plan
* The app needs to have an advanced feature set for admins, allowing them to perform actions such as enrolling new users. This week I'll start implementing these features.
