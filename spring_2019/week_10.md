# Status Update for Week 10

## Last Week's Accomplishments
* Two of our android developers has started working on the Bluetooth feature of the android app. So I've been teaching them how the app uses BLE to communicate with the hardware. I've also provided them important characteristics of the BLE module we were using, as it has a device UUID of `0xFFE0` and service UUID of `0xFFE1`.
* Completed the presentation slides.

## This Week's Plan
* Present at DCC 318.
* Continue helping the android team with BLE stuff.
