# Status Update for Week 10

## Last Week's Accomplishments
* We conducted testing on a door in Amos Eaton, and **it works!**
    *  We modified the microcontroller code to work with the doors. The door requires the relay to be on for approximately 1s 
       in order to open the door. After a 20 second interval, the door closes automatically. The Arduino code is updated to match 
       this procedure.
* Found some issues in the app and opened some issues in the repository. Will probably work on them this week. 
* I am learning Android Developement with Kotlin and it has been easy for me as it's similar to Swift. Hopefully I'll be able to contribute to the Android Repository soon.
    
## This Week's Plan
* Prepare the app for the App Store submission.
* Start designing a logo for ADC.
* Address the issues in the app.
* Keep looking over the app to see if there are rooms for improvements.
